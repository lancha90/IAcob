## 🏃‍♂️ Running the agent

The agent's portfolio is stored in `portfolio.json`:

```json
{
  "cash": 95.44,
  "holdings": {
    "AAPL": 4,
    "CLNE": 56
  },
  "history": [
    {
      "date": "2025-06-21T12:43:07.141Z",
      "type": "buy",
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "shares": 4,
      "price": 201.5,
      "total": 806
    }
  ]
}
```

- **cash**: Available cash balance for trading
- **holdings**: Current stock positions (ticker: number of shares)
- **history**: Complete record of all trades

### Local execution

Run the trading agent manually:

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute one trading session where the agent will:

1. Check the current portfolio
2. Analyze market conditions
3. Make trading decisions
4. Update the portfolio

### Automated execution via GitHub Actions

The agent is configured to run automatically every hour via GitHub Actions. To enable this:

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add a new repository secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
4. The agent will now run automatically every hour

You can also trigger a manual run from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
